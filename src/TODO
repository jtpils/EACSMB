BUGS:
------------------
fix lighting algorithm - partially done!

fix tex scaling algorithm

segfault when custom decal start/end points are the same

when spawing and both points are close to the same point, merge with closest



GUI:
-------------------
sliders
scrolling windows with clipping
window borders
buttons
select boxes
check/radio boxes

animations
proper resource cleanup
semi-global options struct to specify default sizes for elements by type
convert to megashader
text wrapping

 
SOONER:
-------------------

update road network with quad tree

convert point lights to billboard sprites with geom shader

sane version of dirname

organized logging

fix alpha blending blowing out normals

some sort of generic 3d marker utility
3d axis indicators

building generator
	pedestals
	courtyards
	fences and walls


decal mesh generation
	triangle clipping
	terrain area stats

switch to getopt lib

json saving

clean up text rendering function

standard base set of uniforms for all shaders (depends on #include partially)
rebuild eye/view code


proper terrain scaling (mostly done)

implement real lighting - DONE!

texture generation from noise

extrusion of a 2d shape along a spline
	perhaps the shape is a spline, allowing even better LoD

adjust shader log text for real line numbers
add #include support to shaders


LATER:
--------------------

frustum culling for meshes and other items
   in compute shaders

fancy thin coverage-to-alpha wires

prevent zooming through the terrain

generated trees

mouse pointer cursors

error reporting on max_events being insufficient, possibly somethign to dump the queue

make all functions static that need to be

volumetric clouds and ground fog with projected translucent shadows

stateful particle system

fix lines
terrain texture blending
terrain texture atlas & json loader - DONE!

fix all reallocs
check all lib fn return values

memory cleanup in json lib
json utils:
	object unpacker to string/string vector map






IDEAS:
--------------------
animated building demolitions
buildings should not change often, as in real life
day and night cycle
randomized building generator/customizer. swap out colors, fiddle with texture layering.
freeform park-as-a-zone, with auto layout generator
automatically generate residential yards and corporate parks
difficulty level multiplies water/electric usage, boosts crime, decreases economic demand
rain and clouds, should show in reflections
fog
destroyed buildings should fall into one another
fishing and hunting licenses
"football traffic"
tides
plant aspen and redwood as forest fire breaks
sieze forest lands and log for profit
a slider for strictness that police enforce the laws
circuit-breaker high tension towers
electrical substations
lightning problems
flower farms
sewers and storm drains


disasters:
flood
earthquake
huge raging fires
asteroid
volcano
riots, celebration riots
parades
rapture
toxic waste spill
parasite company that sucks the life out of people and takes over too much of the city, then fails
recession
pope/president visit
mudslides
hurricane
hipster infestation
gang/mafia wars
blizzard
oil spill
industrial accident explosions
unions/strikes
soccer riots

collapse of socialism


power plants:
geothermal
wind
solar
tidal

metrics:
crime
air/water/ground pollution
noise
land value
dollars per sq ft for renting/leasing
red tape
sin
political activism
corruption
regulation
cost of living
consumer confidence
general niceness of area
local uniformity (you get dinged for putting a bunch of the same park in te same place)
bums
unemployment/jobs
civilian contempt for the government
nationalism


ordinances:
ban/regulate/tax gambling
ban/regulate/tax prostitution
ban/regulate/tax guns
ban/regulate/tax alcohol consumption
ban/regulate/tax alcohol production
business licenses
B&O taxes
sales taxes
property taxes
traffic fines
strictness of building codes
there should be a constant stream of pork-barrel petitioners trying to force people to buy their shit
plastic bag ban
car emissions
set default speed limit
lane splitting
drinking age
free wifi
B/R/T home gardens
B/R/T livestock
B/R/T pets
B/R/T home businesses
B/R/T a zillion different occupations
a million kinds of socialism
